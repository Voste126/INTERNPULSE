## Our Story

We’ve observed that many aspiring and talented developers, designers, and product managers struggle to secure their first job or opportunity in tech due to a lack of experience or evidence of skills.

This challenge arises because some aspiring techies believe they can learn coding, design, or product management within a few months and immediately land a well-paying job, which is not always the case.

Hence, we launched **InternPulse** to address this issue!

InternPulse helps aspiring software developers, product designers, product managers, virtual assistants, and data analysts to gather enough evidence of skills, learn how to work in teams, deal with pressure, quickly expand their knowledge, network effectively, and discover unique ways to monetize their skills.

This prepares them to secure their first job or opportunity in the tech industry.

We’ve served over 600+ tech enthusiasts from countries like Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, United States, Germany, Ghana, Uganda, United Kingdom, Lesotho, Rwanda, Canada, Malawi, and more.
