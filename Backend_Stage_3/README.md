# Individual Task: Develop a RESTful Payment Gateway API for Small Businesses

## Objective

Create a basic RESTful API that enables small businesses to accept payments from customers using payment gateways such as PayPal, Paystack, or Flutterwave. The API should focus on minimal customer information, including:

- Name
- Email
- Payment amount

### Key Requirements

- **No user authentication**: The API should function without requiring user authentication.
- **Versioning**: Implement API versioning for better maintainability.
- **CI/CD**: Automate testing and deployment using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines.

## Endpoints

The API should follow RESTful best practices and include versioning.

### 1. Initiate a Payment

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/payments`  
**Description**: Initiates a payment.  
**Request Body**:

```json
{
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "customer_email": "john@example.com",
    "amount": 50.00
}
```

### 2. Retrieve Payment Status

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/payments/{id}`  
**Description**: Retrieves the status of a specific payment transaction.  

**Example Response**:

```json
{
    "payment": {
        "id": "PAY-123",
        "customer_name": "John Doe",
        "customer_email": "john@example.com",
        "amount": 50.00,
        "status": "completed"
    },
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Payment details retrieved successfully."
}
```

## Notes

- Ensure the API adheres to RESTful principles.
- Use proper HTTP status codes for responses.
- Include automated tests to validate functionality.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment.
- Focus on simplicity and usability for small businesses.

## For Django Developers

### Task Details

#### Backend Setup

- Develop using Django REST Framework.
- Use a payment gateway plugin or manually integrate the payment API.

#### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Test**: Use Django's testing framework or `pytest-django` to verify payment processing and status checks.
- **Build**: Ensure the application builds and all dependencies are installed.
- **Deploy**: Deploy to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, Render, or similar.

#### Sample `.github/workflows/django.yml`

```yaml
name: Django CI

on:
    push:
        branches: [ main ]
    pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        strategy:
            max-parallel: 4
            matrix:
                python-version: [3.8]

        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
            uses: actions/setup-python@v2
            with:
                python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        - name: Install Dependencies
            run: |
                python -m pip install --upgrade pip
                pip install -r requirements.txt
        - name: Run Tests
            run: |
                python manage.py test
```

### Deliverables

1. A functional RESTful API for processing payments with:
     - Versioning
     - No user authentication
     - Clear status messages
2. A CI/CD pipeline setup in GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
3. Documentation detailing:
     - How to run the service locally
     - How to understand the tests
     - How to deploy using the CI/CD pipeline
